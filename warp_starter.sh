# A script to start my WARP job -- probably something from the DDIP pipeline
# hacked up by Tomasz Malisiewicz (tomasz@cmu.edu)
# Run like: ./warp_starter.sh script_name 10 2
# Above command will run matlab sript script_name repeated 
# 10 times taking up 2 cores per instance

#Logs are written to /lustre/${USER}/outputs/
